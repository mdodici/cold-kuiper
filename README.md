# Collisional evolution of a belt of TNOs on non-circular orbits

We're interested in how the eccentricity and size distribution of a belt of trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) evolves over time. While previous works have studied how the size distribution of a belt changes with collisions, assuming a constant eccentricity, we will try to understand how their eccentricities evolve simultaneously.

We set up a grid in size-eccentricity space and place an initial distribution of bodies on this grid. We can calculate the collision rate between two bodies at any given points on this grid, as well the center-of-mass eccentricity and the size distribution of the fragments. With this information, we can evolve our initial distribution forward. At each timestep, we take the current distribution and compute an outflow and inflow rate of bodies into each cell based on the rate of collisions that cell is involved in (for outflow) and the distributed fragments of bigger bodies being broken (for inflow). With this, we determine an appropriate $dt$ for this timestep and take a step forward and repeat. 



This model is created to test an alternative formation pathway for the cold classical Kuiper Belt (CCKB). It is typically understood that the CCKB -- a relatively flat, circular kernel of the Kuiper Belt -- formed *in situ* from a disk of material at $42-47\text{ au}$. This puts constraints on the dynamical history of the outer solar system, including on the presence of a ninth planet today or in the past. However, we know the main protoplanetary nebula of the solar system must have stopped at $\sim 30 \text{ au}$ in order to stop the migration of Neptune; the cause of a gap between this edge and the CCKB-forming disk is not well understood. 

We propose an alternative: there was no disk at $42-47\text{ au}$. We know that Neptune has a history of scattering sub-Pluto bodies out to such distances and beyond -- we see a large number of such bodies today, across a range of semimajor axes, with eccentricities high enough to bring them back to perihelia $q\sim 30 \text{ au}$. If this "scatter belt" was more dense early in the history of the solar system, perhaps collisions between the constituent bodies could have provided a source of small, circularized dust from which the CCKB could form.
