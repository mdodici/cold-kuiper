# Collisional evolution of a belt of TNOs on non-circular orbits

We're interested in how the eccentricity and size distribution of a belt of trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) evolves over time. While previous works have studied how the size distribution of a belt changes with collisions, assuming a constant eccentricity, we will try to understand how their eccentricities evolve simultaneously.

This is motivated by a desire to understand a possible alternative formation pathway for the cold classical Kuiper Belt (CCKB). It is typically understood that the CCKB formed in place from a
